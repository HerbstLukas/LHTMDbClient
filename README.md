LHTMDbClient
==============


- LHTMDbClient is an iOS wrapper on top of AFNetworking to interact with [themoviedb.org](www.themoviedb.org) API.
- This project is forked from Javi Lorbada - [JLTMDbClient](https://github.com/JaviLorbada/JLTMDbClient)

## Installation: ##

- The best way to get LHTMDbClient is by using [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org/). <br>
	(currently only via pod and the point to git availible because: "[!] Push access is currently disabled while we allow for owners to claim their Pods.") <br>
```
pod 'LHTMDbClient, git: => https://github.com/HerbstLukas/LHTMDbClient.git'
```
- [How to install CocoaPods](https://speakerdeck.com/javilorbada/introduction-to-cocoapods?slide=13)

- Or you just clone this repository and add the LHTMDbClient folder to your project.


## Demo App:
<br>
Not done yet. Will follow.

## Usage: ##

1. Get your API KEY from [themoviedb.org](http://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api)

> "A TMDb user account is required to request an API key. Commercial users are approved on a per application basis. As always, you must attribute TMDb as the source of your data. Please be sure to read the [API FAQ](http://www.themoviedb.org/faq/api)"

2. Add LHTMDbClient to your application, and set up your API KEY in the AppDelegate - didFinishLaunchingWithOptions.

```
#import <LHTMDbClient.h>
```

```
[[LHTMDbClient sharedAPIInstance] setAPIKey:@"API_KEY"];
```
3. Call a service to get the response from the server *, i.e:


```
[[LHTMDbClient sharedAPIInstance] GET:kLHTMDbMoviePopular withParameters:nil andResponseBlock:^(id response, NSError *error) {
    if(!error){
        fetchedData = response;
        NSLog(@"Popular Movies: %@",fetchedData);
    }
}];
```
- When you want to get a specifik episode of an season you can do it like this: 

```
    [[LHTMDbClient sharedAPIInstance] GET:kLHTMDbTV withParameters:@{@"id":self.showId ,@"season_number":self.seasonNr, @"episode_number":self.episodeNr} andResponseBlock:^(id response, NSError *error)
    {
        if (!error)
        {
            self.tvShwoData = response;
            NSLog(@"%@", self.tvShwoData);
        } else
        {
            NSLog(@"%@", error);
        }
    }];
```
Options have to be NSStrings - and you have to use the IDs @"id", @"season_number" and @"episode_number". <br>
See the Table of contents which request require which options. <br>
